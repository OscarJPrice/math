# math
This library is my basic attempt at a calculator. It is designed to be able to replace a graphing calculator. The goal is for to be able to take anti-derivatives, derivatives, find zeros on a graph, and output that to a screen.
Fair warning, as a 1st year CSC student, full on antiderivative calculation may never happen
